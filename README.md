# DiscordEasyCommandsPLUS

This library is a mod of the "Discord easy commands" library made by Linkfy. This library adds useful commands like sending more than one message, and comming soon there will be even more things. To invite the bot to your server, just go to this link:
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1138785082132398110&permissions=8&scope=bot

Current functions:
bot.setCommand(String <command>, list <messages to send>)
bot.run(String <token>)

This will work better if you use it from replit, as the bot won't stop being active even if you close the page.
